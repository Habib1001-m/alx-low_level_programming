## Learning Objectives

### General

- Gain an appreciation for the power and versatility of C programming
- Understand the historical significance of C and its inventors: Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds
- Explore the compilation process and what happens when you type "gcc main.c"
- Learn about the entry point and the role of the "main" function in a C program
- Master various methods of printing text using printf, puts, and putchar
- Discover how to determine the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- Become proficient in compiling C code using gcc
- Familiarize yourself with the default program name when compiling with gcc
- Adhere to the official C coding style and validate your code using betty-style
- Learn effective strategies for finding the appropriate header to include when using standard library functions
- Understand how the return value of the main function influences the overall program execution

## Requirements

### C

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file must be present at the root of the repository, providing an overview of the repository's contents
- Each project should have its own README.md file, located in the project's folder, providing a description of the project
- Compilation should generate no errors or warnings
- The use of the system function is not allowed
- Code should adhere to the Betty style, which can be validated using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

### Shell Scripts
