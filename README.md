## Introduction

This repository is part of the ALX System Engineering Program and is dedicated to low-level programming in C. It provides a hands-on approach to mastering key concepts, tools, and techniques necessary for building robust and efficient software systems.

## Getting Started

To start exploring and working with the projects and exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/alx-low_level_programming.git](https://github.com/Habib1001-m/alx-low_level_programming)

    Navigate to the project or exercise folder that you wish to explore.

    Read the project's README.md file to understand its objectives, requirements, and any additional instructions.

    Begin coding using your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

    After completing a project or exercise, test and compile the code following the provided instructions.

    Explore other projects and exercises in the repository to continuously enhance your C programming skills.

## learning-objectives

    Gain a deep appreciation for the power and versatility of C programming.
    Understand the historical significance of C and its influential creators: Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
    Explore the compilation process and the intricacies involved when using the "gcc" compiler.
    Comprehend the significance of the entry point and the role of the "main" function in a C program.
    Master various methods of printing text using printf, puts, and putchar.
    Learn how to determine the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof.
    Become proficient in compiling C code using gcc with specific options.
    Familiarize yourself with the default program name when compiling with gcc.
    Adhere to the official C coding style and validate your code using betty-style.
    Develop effective strategies for finding the appropriate header to include when utilizing standard library functions.
    Understand how the return value of the main function influences the overall program execution.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into projects, each focusing on specific aspects of low-level programming. The structure follows ALX guidelines:

    Each project has its folder containing project-specific files.
    A README.md file in the root provides an overview of the repository, and each project folder contains a README.md file describing the project.

## Requirements
# C

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
    Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
    Files should end with a new line.
    Presence of a README.md file at the root providing an overview of the repository's contents.
    Each project should have its own README.md file in the project's folder describing the project.
    Compilation should generate no errors or warnings.
    Avoid using the system function.
    Code should adhere to the Betty style, validated using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

# Shell Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
    Testing on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
    Each script should consist of exactly two lines (use $ wc -l file to confirm).
    Files should end with a new line.
    The first line of each script should be exactly #!/bin/bash.
