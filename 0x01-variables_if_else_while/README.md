# C - Variables, if, else, while

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the usage of variables, if-else statements, and while loops. Each program focuses on a specific task and provides the expected output.

## List of Programs

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

   This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It then prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The last digit**

   This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. It then prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

   - File: [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**

   This program prints the alphabet in lowercase using the `putchar` function.

   - File: [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)

4. **alphABET**

   This program prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase using the `putchar` function.

   - File: [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)

5. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**

   This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using the `putchar` function.

   - File: [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)

6. **Numbers**

   This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

   - File: [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)

7. **Numberz**

   This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 without using any variable of type `char`.

   - File: [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)

8. **Smile in the mirror**

   This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse using the `putchar` function.

   - File: [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)

9. **Hexadecimal**

   This program prints all the numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase.

   - File: [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)

10. **Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**

    This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces.

    - File: [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)

Feel free to explore each program and run them to see the output. Happy coding!
