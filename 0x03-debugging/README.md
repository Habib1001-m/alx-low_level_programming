# C Debugging Project

This repository contains the solutions to the debugging project in the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. The project focuses on understanding the concept of debugging, different methods of manual debugging, and how to read error messages effectively.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of debugging in software development.
- Learn various methods of manual debugging.
- Develop skills in reading and interpreting error messages.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Each task should have its own corresponding C file and header file.
- A README.md file should be present at the root of the repository, providing an overview of the repository.
- Each task should have its own README.md file, located in the respective task folder, providing a description of the task.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Multiple mains

In this task, we are provided with a main file that tests the `positive_or_negative()` function. Our goal is to create a file named `0-main.c` that tests the function for the case of 0. We are not required to code the solution/function, but only to test it.

### Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

In this task, we are given a main file that contains code causing an infinite loop. Our task is to comment out the part of the code that is causing the infinite loop, without adding or removing any lines of code. The output should indicate that the infinite loop has been avoided.

### Task 2: 0 > 972?

This task involves fixing a program that prints the largest of three integers. The current implementation is incorrect, as it always prints 0 as the largest number. Our goal is to fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of the three numbers, regardless of the case.

### Task 3: Leap year

In this task, we have a program that converts a date to the day of the year and determines the number of days left in the year, considering leap years. The program currently fails to handle leap years correctly. Our task is to fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that it works correctly for all dates and leap years.

Please refer to the respective task folders for more details on each task.
